To build: make

To use: we provide 2 shells to show how to use the LZ-index. Note that
        you only need to include "lzindex.h" in your program.

(1) indexshell <textfile>
        it indexes the text file and writes the index on disk,
        under the names <textfile>.*

(2) searchshell <indexfile>
        it reads the index <indexfile>.* from disk and answers
        queries.

query format: just write down the word, the newline character finishes the
                query string
              the query "END" finishes the program
              a query of the form c:<string> just counts the occurrences
              a query of the form p:<string> shows the positions of the occs
              a query of the form s:<string> prints the lines containing occs
              default is s:
              a query of the form <x>:END does not finish the program
